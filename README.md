This is a file of everything that I use for linux
(This was made using Fedora 36 btw)

## Info

Recommended to use `stow` cli tool. 
Fedora: `sudo dnf install stow`

## Installation
1. Clone repository into your home directory. `git clone https://github.com/Gsnail157/dotfiles.git`
2. Change directory into the new repository. `cd dotfiles`
3. Use `stow */` to create symlink for all folders OR `stow folder-name` to create a symlink for a single folder
